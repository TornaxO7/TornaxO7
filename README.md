# Hi!
I'm TornaxO7, a 18 years old fresh computer science student.

This is my language ranking:

1. Rust
2. C and Assembly (only for a [MSP430](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI_MSP430)
   and only partially writing, mainly reading)
3. Python, Vimscript

I can also code (only partially) in Dart, Java, Lua and Typescript.

For documenting stuff, I mainly use LaTeX,
[dot](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) and markdown.

# Interests
I'd declare myself as an low-level enthusiast, due to my interest to ARM CPUs
and Reverse-Engineering. That's why I'm currently working on [Tornarec](https://github.com/TornaxO7/Tornarec), which should be a NintendoDS emulator (written in Rust).
